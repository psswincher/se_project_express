# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project uses mongoose to interface a front-end with a mongodb database via an Express server, allowing users to create and retrieve clothing items tied to their account. It handles errors through custom classes, and authenticates users with secure authorization, and is fully deployed to the web!

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
